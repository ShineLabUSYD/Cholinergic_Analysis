# Cholinergic_Analysis
The following code corresponds to the analysis of two macaque fMRI time-series data (data originally published in 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.01.032). It includes all code relating to the analysis of the data using the attractor landscape analysis, information theory analysis and the simple neural mass model.

The following code is a sample of code used to analyse the data through the attractor landscape analysis, information theory and the neural mass model. It corresponding follow has code relevant to the analysis described in the manuscript "Causal evidence for cholinergic stabilisation of attractor landscape dynamics". 
The transfer entropy folder contains data from the transfer entropy calculations we ran on the time-series data for cholingergic inhibition and no inhibition for the two macaque fMRI data. 

Requirements:
Information Theory and Neural Mass model require toolbox instillations from other contributors. Please see individual code for corresponding toolboxes.

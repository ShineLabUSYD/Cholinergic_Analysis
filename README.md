# Cholinergic_Analysis
The following code corresponds to the analysis of two macaque fMRI time-series data (data originally published in 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.01.032). It includes all code relating to the analysis of the data using the attractor landscape analysis, information theory analysis and the simple neural mass model.

The following code is a sample of code used to analyse the data through the attractor landscape analysis, information theory and the neural mass model.

Note -
Information Theory and Neural Mass model require toolbox instillations from other contributors. Please see individual code for corresponding toolboxes.
